# Brick

Brick is a toy programming language inspired by Without Boats' [Notes on a Smaller Rust](https://without.boats/blog/notes-on-a-smaller-rust/).

Its principle goal is to be enjoyable to use. To that end, it should:

1. Allow for very fast iteration
2. Prevent frustrating errors
3. Trade a little performance for a little convenience, where necessary

My plan is for Brick to compile to WASM, partially because I think it would be more fun to support a WASM backend than LLVM. Also, WASM is fun and LLVM isn't.
