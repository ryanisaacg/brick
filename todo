error reporting:
- typecheck errors
- error presentation
- ability to continue in face of errors

linear IR:
- (maybe) AST rewrite the HIR to remove all control flow from expressions (possibly introducing "registers" if needed)
- (maybe) AST rewrite the HIR to disambiguate between variable references and function references

collections:
- arrays:
    - array push to end
    - type syntax
    - allow empty arrays to typecheck
    - length() method on arrays
- dicts:
    - dict type syntax
    - insert new entries into dictionaries
    - use a hash table
- slices
- boxes (maybe not - maybe just RC?)
- rc's:
    - basic RCs
    - can take RC'ed references to collections? maybe even RC'ed subreferences to user-defined collections?
- cells

borrow checker and lifetimes:
- check borrows for function calls
- handle assignments - both in terms of drop detection and borrow detection
- allow disjoint borrows of struct fields
- correctly mark references through collection indices
- mark custom types as copy
- copy vs clone vs affine vs linear?
- drop (hard-coded)
- drop (custom)

metaprogramming:
- proc macros? comptime? compile-time reflection (what is that even)? no metaprogramming?
- use whatever mechanism above for ser/des

allocator:
- support dealloc

syntax:
- remove ; and , requirements?
- keyword arguments
- maybe separate syntax for i64 / f64 literals

import support:
- allow imports to have nested paths (sugar for recursively expanding?)
- allow imports to include a list of things, with an optional catch-all

modules:
- modules can be indexed in a type expression context
- modules can be indexed in a struct / variant literal context
- modules can be declared explicitly

returns:
- typecheck returns
- allow void returns

references:
- allow calls to associated functions through references (checking correct reference type)

static function vs method:
    - struct associated functions support "self"
        - self can be declared as a typeless parameter syntactically
        - self typechecks correctly
        - IR transforms code properly to pass self into the function
    - union associated functions support "self"
    - static associated functions:
        - structs
        - unions
        - interfaces?

interfaces:
- self parameters for interfaces can only be passed by reference (otherwise linear IR doesn't work)
    - when making the method -> function conversion, automatically take a reference if it's required
    - mandate by-reference parameters for interfaces
- unions:
    - unions can be converted to interfaces
    - unions have associated functions
- modules can be converted to interfaces:
    - produce and consume a nullpointer for the vtable call? (might mean we need to generate shim functions)
- interfaces can be converted between each other:
    - in typechecking
    - in the IR
    - in the interpreter
- interface conversion:
    - checks return statements
    - checks implicit returns due to the end of blocks
    - check assignments
- interfaces are supported in the interpreter:
    - mutable interfaces (significant borrowck implications)

interface adapters:
- allow an interface to define an impl for itself on foreign types, limited version of Rust's traits

strings:
- string manipulation
- interpolation literals
- multiline literals

semantic analysis:
- handle return, break statements in CFG parsing

anonymous types:
- anonymous struct
- anonymous union
- anonymous module
- anonymous interface

unions:
- they work:
    - union variants can be assigned to
    - incorrect variants return null instead of aborting on invalid access
- union literal syntax that makes sense
- unions can extend unions (refer to fields with nested access?)
- unions can have empty variants
- match statement (destructure unions, return value if exhaustive)
- are unions the right choice?? not 100% sure
- rename to enum? variant?

boolean operators:
- boolean and / or:
    - the borrowchecker knows they short circuit
- equality / inequality:
    - applicable to nullable values

null:
- ?. operator
- ! operator, which throws if the value is an error (requires errors)
- basic null flow analysis - maybe a special operation to de-null stuff

errors:
- functions can define `throws`
- throw operator creates and returns an error
- try operator returns an error if one exists
- functions may optionally define a union that they throw, and all `throw`s and `try`s in the function must conform to that union
- allow discriminating on errors with a try/catch type construct or something similar for non-throws functions

coroutines:
- decide on some coroutine facility
- coroutines hold parameter borrows for their lifetime

generic programming:
- functions can take type parameters and typecheck properly
- types can be parameterized
- structs and unions can have associated functions
- there are interfaces which can require specific associated functions
- structs and unions can be passed in place of an interface
- interfaces can constrain generic parameters

extern:
- extern functions are unsafe
- externs can only do C FFI stuff, for ease of wasm backend

unsafe:
- functions can be declared unsafe
- you can have unsafe blocks (or statements?)
- you can only call unsafe functions from within unsafe blocks

units of measure:
- design some system to separate units of measure into various domains (e.g. a "screen pixel" different from a "logical pixel")

language rules:
- don't allow recursive types without indirection
