stuff that I can pretty much do in any order:
- the rest of the math operators
- the rest of the comparison operators
- compiler diagnostics
- test suite
- integer promotion
- integer -> float promotion
- float -> int casting

stuff that requires thinking:
- product types
- sum types
- pattern matching
- function declarations
- function calls
- constant evaluation
- external environment declarations

stuff that requires learning:
- closures
- interesting optimizations
- borrow-checking
- binary debug info
