import support:
- discover and parse modules that are imported from current module
- allow imports to have nested paths
- allow imports to include a list of things, with an optional catch-all
- properly pull foreign resolved types from imports

semantic analysis:
- allow type expressions, maybe hash types for this (bidrectional hashmap?)
- handle return, break statements in CFG parsing
- attach types to expressions, ensure they match properly

ir:
- lower code into SSA

backend:
- turn SSA into lua
